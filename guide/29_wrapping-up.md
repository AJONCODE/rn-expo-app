Here are some topics you might want to look into:

- animation - check out the [Animated API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/animations) for pure native animations and [Lottie](https://github.com/react-native-community/lottie-react-native) (a React Native animation library from Airbnb) for pre-made animations
- images - the built in Image component in React Native is not great, so check out [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image)
- bottom tab navigator - most every app has one. Check out the docs on how to add one [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator/)
- useMemo - it's another React hook and a handy one. I use it a lot. Handy for memoising things. Read more about it [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo)

## Advanced topics

If you're serious about building your own app, here are some things you might want to look into:

- [CodePush](https://github.com/microsoft/code-push) - a tool that all allows you to do over the air updates to your deployed app (kind of how the Expo app works, but you'll be in charge!)
- [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox) - an end to end testing framework for React Native
- [react-native-testing-library](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-testing-library) - unit testing library for React Native
- [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) - a tool for automating building and releasing your apps
